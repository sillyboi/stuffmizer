randomiser
==========

Generate a random result based on multiple arrays. I couldn't find one as simple as I needed so I just made one myself.

- remove line breaks in text with this tool http://www.textfixer.com/tools/remove-line-breaks.php or similar
- Edit the arrays in random.js to change your variables
- make sure to edit the joining words so your randomness makes sense
- comment out variables if you don't need all three, or add more, whatever.
- multiple words will always split so only one word answers please.

**This will be way better when I...**

- ~~don't force the browser to refresh to refresh my array, that's dumb~~
- ~~get a bit of animation in there~~
- try and split arrays into separate files so lots can be made easily and plugged together
- allow user to edit words and arrays from website
